# Web Crawler

A super simple web crawler - randomly follow links from a starting URL
and display those to the user.

This project was inspired by a lecture in my Information Retrieval class
at the University of Kansas.

## Installation

1. Install a browser extension that disables CORS (for example, [CORS
   Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/))
2. Start any webserver at current directory and open it in the browser.
   (for example, [python web
   server](https://realpython.com/python-http-server/))
