# Shadow game

A "hot and col" kind of game that doesn't use the screen at all!

A dot is spawned in a random location on the screen. You press on the screen
tactically to find where it is. Your only feedback is vibration - the closer you
are to the dot, the weaker the vibration.

On AMOLED devices, the screen stays pure black. The game was designed to be
playable under the desk in a classroom - since no screen is involved, noone even
knows you are playing it.

Unfortunately, vibration API is not supported on iOS WebKit
