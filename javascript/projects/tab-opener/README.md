# Tab Reader

Barebones Google Chrome extension for reading a list of webpages one by one

## Installation

- Open `chrome://extensions` in your Google Chrome.
- Press the `Load Unpacked` button in the upper right corner of the screen
- Select this folder when promoted
- Enjoy!

## My workflow

- Open interesting links from email newsletters on my phone
- Once I get 1,000+ open tabs, extract the list of tabs as urls and go through
  them on the computer
- For each tab, summarize it, drop it, read it, or save it as .md using
  [Text Hoarder](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/text-hoarder) for further
  processing to audio.
