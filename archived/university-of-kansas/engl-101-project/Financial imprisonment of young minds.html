						We are living in incredible times in a world that is ever-changing and evolving at a speed
						never before imagined. There are more life improvements yearly than the person one millennium
						ago would see in their lifetime. And while this is good for the quality of life, <b>the
						                                                                                    system of
						                                                                                    education
						                                                                                    is
						                                                                                    struggling to keep up</b>.
<br><br>
						Universities are very important for any society as they are the place where bright minds are supposed to get the knowledge they need to change their community. Yet, <b>the reality is not as positive</b>.
<br><br>
						A lot of passionate people cannot afford the ever-increasing tuition cost. Some go on to take
						on student debt, which stands at <b>1.5 trillion dollars</b> as of January 2020. Instead of being
						                                       empowered by higher education, students find themselves in an outdated system and a mind-blowing debt on a bank account with no practical skills to show for it.
<br><br>
						In contrast to the desired effect, this imprisons students and makes them be hunted by an unpayable financial obligation that crashes all the dreams of future success.

						And even though there have been a lot of debates as to how we can solve this problem, I
						         want
						     to uncover the truth of this huge problem that looms over the heads of bright minds by showing the root of the problem and what students and universities can do to solve it.
<br><br><br><h3>Tuition costs grow faster than inflation</h3>
						When looking at any graph or chart and comparing the cost of something over the years, it is
						important not to forget the influence of inflation, which is about <b>2% per year</b>.

<p class="credit">Photo by <a class="credit" href="https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing" target="_blank">CollegeBoard - Trends in College Pricing 2019</a></p>

						Yet, even with that in mind, the increase in tuition costs passed any other change, <b>growing at about 10% a year</b>.

						<h3>Why are tuition costs on the rise?</h3>

						There are various reasons for this, but the biggest factor was the increase in the demand for higher education. The simplest law of the market states that higher demand causes prices to increase.
<br><br>
						Today, almost every young adult attends college which is a huge difference from the way it
						was only 50 years ago. Besides that, there has been a sharp increase in scholarships and tuition waivers, which were almost not existent before <b>1978, the year when the student debt system was officially implemented</b> in the USA. This caused prices to inflate even more since universities were able to get more money out of some students.
<br><br>
						Besides that, we can all admit that the role of college has shifted dramatically over the
						years. This conclusion can be reached when we see that only about ⅓ of the university’s money
						goes towards salaries for teachers and professionals, whereas the rest goes to pay for
						<b>campuses, dorms, stadiums, helping the local community and advertisement</b>.
<br><br>
						Yet, there is one more area of expense that was almost nonexistent before: all the services
						and advising centers available for students, the cost of running which has been included in
						the tuition fee. Usually, these include legal help, psychological advising, career center,
						driving school, Medical Center, constant events and organizations available on campus along
						with other things that <b>do add up and can have a considerable impact</b> on the tuition fee.
						                          One can conclude that college is no longer only about studying, but also about the experience and connection with others.
<br><br>
						Of course, with tuition costs being the deciding factor for students, such a drastic change makes more students than ever reconsider the options available and question whether higher education is worth it in the first place.

						This means that for the first time in years, demand for universities is not growing. Whereas, existing students are forced to carry on this burden that will reflect on their lives in the form of student loans long after they finished their education.

						<br><br>
						And nobody is affected by this more than international students, who are <b>paying about 4
						                                                                            times as
						                                                                            much</b> for education as domestic students. This led 2015 to be the first year
						                                                                            when the number
						of students coming from China, India, and Saudi Arabia stopped growing and started
						decreasing, with students seeking accessible education or other countries, like Canada or
						Australia as a place where they are going to receive their education from.
<br><br>
						Besides all of the expenses that students need to pay for, international students are also
						faced with <b>exam costs, visa application fees, oversee flights cost, SEVIS fees, higher
						                  tuition costs, academic accelerator programs cost, and other expenses
						              related to relocating to a new country</b>. And one more area most people do not
						think about is that some students’ tuition fees go towards helping other students pay their
						tuition. This heavy burden mostly affects international students, as most scholarships are
						not available for them. Speaking from personal experience, I can tell that figuring out how to
						pay for all of those costs can make my head spin and, unfortunately, I am not alone...

						<br><h3>How can students pay less for higher education?</h3>

						All of these changes make more and more students ask themself a question: “How do I pay less
						for higher education." It is distressing that not having a higher education is the answer for many, which is a direct result of a broken and outdated educational system. At the same time, others decide to go to a cheaper university or study abroad in a country that has lower tuition costs. For example, my friend chose to study in Malaysia instead of the United Kingdom. His decision was primarily motivated by tuition costs since he only had a choice of not studying abroad or studying somewhere on the other side of the world.
<br><br>
						Yet, there still are other less drastic measures students can take. The common complaint that
						gets voiced is over high costs for school books, which leads students to spend about <b>1000
						                                                                                        dollars yearly</b>.
<br><br>
						While it is only a small fraction of the overall amount of money a student may spend on education, this sum can still be reduced. For example, not all materials are required by the teacher and some of the books can be found online for free.

						Besides that, buying electronic versions of books or getting used copies can be another way
						to decrease this expense. You can even get some books for free from your
						professors, if you ask them nicely 😊. This led me to <b>spend
						                                                                                      only 400 dollars</b>	on course
						materials during
						                                                 my freshman year and I hope to spend only half of that next year.
<br><br>
						Some also advertise living off-campus or cooking themselves as a great way to save on money, but these options are unlikely to work for everyone as besides forcing students to worry about matters other than education, it takes time to learn how to cook, buy the equipment, shop for food and prepare it.
<br><br>
						This is why you should try several of these tips to see what works for you personally, since your mileage may vary.

<br><br><br><h3>What about universities?</h3>
						While it is great to use these tips and be responsible when it comes to spending your money, it
						is clear that the rise in the tuition costs is not going to slow down any time soon, requiring us to force universities to take more drastic measures.
<br><br>
						This leads many to understand that universities are not interested in decreasing
						            expenses and tuition costs, as now they can <b>have a budget of multimillion-dollar
						                                                           companies</b>, turning gigantic
						                                                           profits for shareholders without paying taxes, while also receiving federal grants and generous donations.
<br><br>
						In the face of this giant problem, there has been a great trend that is getting more popular in recent years. Studying online is finally getting to be a viable option for many as the internet and online programs are more ubiquitous and students only have to pay for the education and no other expenses that traditionally come with it. I believe that using online resources is truly the way to go and am happy that this trend continues to accelerate.
<br><br>
						We can already find <b>more and more companies requiring no traditional higher education</b> but
						                          offering online courses for all newly hired employees. This shows a
						long term trend that will finally change the field of education for the better. In the
						meantime, we can force universities to spend money more sparingly and decrease the cost as
						well as the number of required textbooks. For example, some classes require students to buy a
						new book every year, making used copies useless, while others force students to buy a lot of
						material that in the end, does not even get to be used by students. Besides having a negative
						financial impact on your savings, it is bad for the environment, when we start to consider all
						the	paper that goes into printing the books.

<br><br><br><h3>Things you should remember</h3>
						In the end, I have a strong belief that the situation with the increase of the tuition costs
						can change and should change, as long as we stay frugal and are committed to making
						universities responsible for all the things they use tuition money for. In the meantime, I
						invite you to try out some of the money-saving tips I described here and consider making a
						proposal to the head of finances in your educational institution.
