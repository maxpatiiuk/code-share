Original URL: [http://mambo.zzz.com.ua/](http://mambo.zzz.com.ua/)

This was the first website of mine that was actually published and advertised
on social media.

It was also my first and only website build on top of a [./template](template).

I iterated on this version for 9 months. See [v1](v1), [v2](v2) and [v3](v3)
folders for progressive improvements.

This website served as a blog for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@maxpatiiuk) and
eventually even housed the first version of my online shop (MAMBO SHOP).
