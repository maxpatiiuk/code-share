# Commissioned Blogs

In high school, I was freelancing as a web developer. As part of that, I
developed template for a blog and for a shop, that were then used to jumpstart
customer's website. This folder holds a bunch of websites create from a single
blog template.

All of these were created in 2017-2018 (10th grade) based on a template I created and reused
for several websites.

The template includes:
- Login/Register/Personal profile (with preferences)/password password
- Admin panel
- Elementary WYSIWYG editor

See also commissions shops:

## Configuration for all of these

1. Create a database from .sql files if provided
