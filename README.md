# code_share

A collection of random code pieces from different projects over the
years.

80% of the code I have ever written is in GitHub and this repository
houses some of that. It includes anything from my first lines of code
in 2012 to my research paper on a CMS system, to slides I used to
present my now closed `Mambo Shop` during various competitions and
other stuff.

Most of the projects that are too small to deserve their own repository
are also here.

Deprecated, obsolete or simply ugly code is located in the
[archived](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/code_share/tree/main/archived/)
folder

A lot of the code present here was written during my 4-year long
programming bootcamp.

Some of the languages, frameworks and topics included here:
 - Assembly (RISC-V)
 - Java (Android)
 - C
   - Arduino
 - C++
   - WinApi
 - C#
   - Windows Forms
   - Unity
 - JavaScript
   - jQuery
   - TypeScript
   - React
   - Next.JS
   - Ramda.js
 - Python
   - Flask
 - PHP (5.6-7.4)
 - SQL
   - MySQL
   - T-SQL
   - MS SQL
 - VHDL
 - HTML
 - CSS
   - Bootstrap 3-4
   - Tailwind
 - SVG
 - Research paper
 - Presentations
 - Notes from university classes

Files that are even more random are located in the
[misc](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/code_share/tree/main/misc/)
directory

Keep in mind that most of the code present here does not represent
my current programming skills or knowledge of these frameworks. E.x,
I learned some good code style practices recently and am, hopefully,
writing nicer code. At the same time, I no longer remember anything
about T-SQL, MS SQL, VHDL, Windows Forms or WinApi.

Similarly, there may be a lot of typos and grammatical errors in these
files. I am still learning English, but my current skills are better
than they were when many of these files were created.

If you want to clone this repository, keep in mind that, despite my
best efforts, it weights more than 1GB.

## Info

Some files are in password-protected archives, but most are freely
available.

Some code is too embarrassing to show. It has been moved to the
`archived` directory, but is still available for viewing.

Besides English, some older files are written in Ukrainian, though it
is not the case for files created after ~2018.

Also, keep in mind that for most of the files, the date they were added
to Git does not correspond to the date they were created (most of them
were written before this repository was created, well, even before I
knew about the existence of Git and GitHub).
