# human_vs_bot_test
This test shows the difference between how humans and bots generate random matrices. The test subject is presented with a grid on the left and is asked to touch random squares (preferably on a device with a touch screen). Then the lead is supposed to click on the **compare** button, to show how much more random computers are
