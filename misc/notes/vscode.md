  - [x] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing
  - [x] toggle git blame (and maybe change width)
  - [ ] Consider keyboard shortcut for "Open in integrated terminal" "when":
        "filesExplorerFocus"
  - [ ] assign keyboard shortcut for "workbench.action.createTerminalEditor" or
        is there Cmd to move current terminal to up?
        (terminal.integrated.defaultLocation) or "Maximize panel size"
        (workbench.action.toggleMaximizedPanel)
  - [ ] Go over TODOs in keymap list below
  - [ ] Learn keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Go over all plugins and their settings and theme settings
- [ ] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/debugging-recipes
- [ ] Setup VS Code tasks (i.e, Jest)
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration-attributes
  - create a problem matcher if not automatic
- [ ] Convert all commonly used shortcuts to vim if possible
- [ ] { // Go to 2nd tab "key": "cmd+2", "Cmd":
      "workbench.action.openEditorAtIndex1" }
- [ ] Hide activity bar once I learn it or at least reduce it
- [ ] Hide status bar once I learn it or at least reduce it
- [ ] Consider doing setting sync in git (maybe "Settings sync" extension)?
  - or do regular takeouts (Profiles: Show Contents)
  - or "Settings Sync: Show Synced Data" is enough?
- [ ] Create profile for Demos based on the main profile (and google/chatgpt
      nice settings for that - i.e autosave, font size) (or just zen mode?)
- [ ] Turn sdk and api into single workspace?
- [ ] Consider always having a pinned full-screen terminal at Cmd+1

### Low

      stepping...

## Plugins

Installed extensions are absent from this list

### Uninstall?

- [ ] Emmet
- [ ] Shell Syntax
  - see if can be replaced by an ESLint plugin

## Find extension for

- [ ] Refactoring (mainly, "Move to existing file")
  - https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29988 is fixed, yet I can't
    see it
  - "Abracadabra, refactor this!" has this feature but it almost never works
- [x] There are a bunch of "git plugins - figure out (also .gitignore)
  - [x] gitignore
    - syntax highlighting available natively
    - I rarely find .gitignore templates useful
- [ ] code coverage
- [ ] docker plugins
- [ ] jsdoc
- [ ] json
- [ ] scopes extension OR vscode profiles:
      https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cfcluan.project-scopes

## Don't forget to use

TODO: Review all installed plugins as a reminder. Also:

- [ ] Node.js REPL
- [ ] Search node_modules

### Maybe later

- [ ] Stencil Tools
  - Maybe once I will start working with Stencil more
- [ ] Shell
  - Is it redundant with the terminal?
  - Is it redundant with the vim extension? (which can execute CLI commands
    too?)
- [ ] Dev Containers

### Tried out and rejected

- [x] Node.js Modules Intellisense
  - Not needed -> available natively
- [x] Web Components Peek
  - Works on local web components only
- [x] Web Components Snippets
  - I don't use snippets
- [x] Save Editors Layout
  - I almost never have more than one editor open
- [x] Markdown Preview Enhanced
  - Redundant with "Markdown All in One" and "GitHub Markdown Preview"
- [x] shell-format
  - Replaced by prettier-plugin-sh
- [x] Code Runner
  - Why does this exist? seems redundant with native code runner
- [x] Emmet Live
  - I am considering disabling emmet entirely
  - To cubersome and few benefits over creating smaller emmet expressions
- [x] eslint-disable-snippets
  - Nice idea, except it uses a hardcoded list of ESLint rules rather than
    dynamically loads enabled rules
- [x] ESLint Disable
  - Redundant with actions already available in the auto fix menu
- [x] Edit csv
  - Horrible UX and buggy. Using Excel Viewer instead (though it's read only,
    but I shouldn't be editing CSVs by hand anyway)
- [x] ArcGIS API for JavaScript Snippets
  - Very out of date
  - Aimed at JS API user, not JS API developer
- [x] Path Intellisense
  - Seems to work natively
- [x] NPM IntelliSense
  - Seems to work natively
- [ ] Test Explorer and Test Adapter Converter
- [ ] Jest Test Explorer
- [ ] Learn Vim
- [ ] Live Preview
- [ ] env/dotenv/native?
- [ ] markdownlint?, unless can be done by prettier or natively?
