# LRP (Login, Register, Profile)

This was a PHP library I created for handling user login, registration,
password reset and user profile.

It took me half a summer to write this, but afterward I reused this code in many
subsequent projects.

This website is a demo website, that holds 3 versions of the LRP library.
