# Ultra minimalistic stopwatch

In the first few months on my first formal job I was doing plenty of performance
testing.

For this, I needed a stopwatch. None of the existing stopwatches were good
enough:

- I didnt want to burn in my screen - this stopwatch is optimized to be pure
  black most of the time (the buttons are black unless clicked. the current time
  shifts its location on the screen to avoid permanent burn in.).
- The stopwatch has sub-second accuracy, but only shows sub-seconds when paused
  to reduce distractions.
- No ads. Minimum distractions.
