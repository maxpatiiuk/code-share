# code_share

A collection of random code pieces from different projects over the
years.

80% of the code I have ever written is in GitHub and this repository
houses some of that. It includes anything from my first lines of code
in 2012 to my research paper on a CMS system, to slides I used to
present my now closed `Mambo Shop` during various competitions and
other stuff.

Most of the projects that are too small to deserve their own repository
are also here.

Only the most recent projects are stored on the `main` branch. For
everything else, there is an [`archived` branch](
https://github.com/maxxxxxdlp/code_share/tree/archived/).

A lot of the code present here was written during my 4-year long
programming bootcamp.

Some of the languages and frameworks included here (and on the
`archived` branch):

 - Assembly (RISC-V)
 - Java (Android)
 - C (Arduino)
 - C++ (WinApi)
 - C# (Windows Forms, Unity)
 - JavaScript (jQuery, TypeScript, React, Next.JS)
 - Python (Flask)
 - PHP (5.6-7.4)
 - SQL (MySQL, T-SQL, MS SQL)
 - VHDL
 - HTML
 - CSS (Bootstrap 3 and 4, Tailwind)

Files that are even more random are located in `Misc`.

## Info

Some files are in password-protected archives, but most are freely
available.
