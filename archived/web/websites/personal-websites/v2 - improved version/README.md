# 2nd version of personal website

Date: April 26, 2016

Even though I was quite proud of this website at the time, it was never
published publicly (see version 3 for first public version).

I was especially proud of what at the time I thought of as a cool idea:
instead of styling separate parts of the page individually, create a
single background image for all. I did this because at the time I wasn't
very proficient with CSS, but was very proficient in Photoshop.
