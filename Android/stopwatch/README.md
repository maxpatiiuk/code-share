# Stopwatch
Behold the most minimalistic, yet advanced stopwatch you have ever seen! This Android app is great for measuring long stretches of time, where your screen needs to be on constantly. In order to minimize the risk of your OLED screen burning out, most of the UI is black and the time passed is shifting its position on the screen.

## Controls
Press on the lower 3rd part of your screen to Start/Stop the timer
Press at the middle of you screen to Pause the timer
Press on the Left or Right side of the middle 3rd part of your screen to add or subtract 1 second from the timer
