						<h2>A STORY OF STOLEN SALAMIS</h2>
					</a><br>
					<p>My son’s Italian landlord in Brooklyn kept a shed out back in which he cured and smoked salamis.
						One night, in the midst of a wave of petty vandalism and theft, the shed was broken into and the
						salamis were taken. My son talked to his landlord about it the next day, commiserating over the
						vanished sausages. The landlord was resigned and philosophical, but corrected him: ‘They were
						not sausages. They were salamis.’ Then the incident was written up in one of the city’s more
						prominent magazines as an amusing and colourful urban incident. In the article, the reporter
						called the stolen goods ‘sausages’. My son showed the article to his landlord, who hadn’t seen
						it. The landlord was interested and pleased that the magazine had seen fit to report the
						incident, but he added: ‘They weren’t sausages. They were salamis.’</p>

						<h2>A STORY TOLD TO ME BY A FRIEND</h2>
					</a><br>
					<p>A friend of mine told me a sad story the other day about a neighbour of hers. He had begun a
						correspondence with a stranger through an online dating service. The friend lived hundreds of
						miles away, in North Carolina. The two men exchanged messages and then photos and were soon
						having long conversations, at first in writing and then by phone. They found that they had many
						interests in common, were emotionally and intellectually compatible, were comfortable with each
						other and were physically attracted to each other, as far as they could tell on the Internet.
						Their professional interests, too, were close, my friend’s neighbour being an accountant and his
						new friend down South an assistant professor of economics at a small college. After some months,
						they seemed to be well and truly in love, and my friend’s neighbour was convinced that ‘this was
						it’, as he put it. When some vacation time came up, he arranged to fly down south for a few days
						and meet his Internet love.

						During the day of travel, he called his friend two or three times and they talked. Then he was
						surprised to receive no answer. Nor was his friend at the airport to meet him. After waiting
						there and calling several more times, my friend’s neighbour left the airport and went to the
						address his friend had given him. No one answered when he knocked and rang. Every possibility
						went through his mind.

						Here, some parts of the story are missing, but my friend told me that what her neighbour learned
						was that, on that very day, even as he was on his way south, his Internet friend had died of a
						heart attack while on the phone with his doctor; my friend’s neighbour, having learned this
						either from the man’s neighbour or from the police, had made his way to the local morgue; he had
						been allowed to view his Internet friend; and so it was here, face to face with a dead man, that
						he first laid eyes on the one who, he had been convinced, was to have been his companion for
						life.</p>

						<h2>ON THE TRAIN</h2>
					</a><br>
					<p>We are united, he and I, though strangers, against the two women in front of us talking so
						steadily and audibly across the aisle to each other. Bad manners.

						Later in the journey I look over at him (across the aisle) and he is picking his nose. As for
						me, I am dripping tomato from my sandwich on to my newspaper. Bad habits.

						I would not report this if I were the one picking my nose.

						I look again and he is still at it.

						As for the women, they are now sitting together side by side and quietly reading, clean and
						tidy, one a magazine, one a book. Blameless.</p>

						<h2>SUSIE BROWN WILL BE IN TOWN</h2>
					</a><br>
					<p>Susie Brown will be in town. She will be in town to sell her things. Susie Brown is moving far
						away. She would like to sell her queen mattress. Do we want her queen mattress? Do we want her
						ottoman? Do we want her bath items?

						It is time to say goodbye to Susie Brown. We have enjoyed her friendship.

						We have enjoyed her tennis lessons.</p>

						<h2>MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN</h2>
					</a><br>
					<p>A poor woodman was cutting down the tree near the edge of a deep pool in the forest. It was late
						in the day and the Woodman was tired. He had been working since sunrise and his strokes were not
						as sure as they had been early that morning. Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out
						of his hands into the pool.

						The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had
						not enough money to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury
						suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman told what had happened, and
						straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool. When he came up again he held a wonderful
						golden axe.

						“Is this your axe?” Mercury asked the Woodman.

						“No,” answered the honest Woodman, “that is not my axe.”

						Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time he brought up
						an axe of silver, but the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a
						wooden handle.

						Mercury dived down for the third time and when he came up again he had the very axe that had
						been lost.

						The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god
						enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman’s honesty.

						“I admire your honesty,” he said, “and as a reward you may have all three axes, the gold and the
						silver as well as your own.”</p>
